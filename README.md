# challenge-2-UTA-tritsch
Challenge 2 for UT Austin's Full Stack Bootcamp

## Description

Welcome to my Colorado Rockies themed advanced CSS portfolio! This challenge was a huge learning process for me as I made a big effort to include all of the concepts I've learned so far in Bootcamp. I struggled with the concept of flexbox leading up to this, and rather than avoid it, I wanted to take it on as much as I could, and I think it shows here. My motivation behind this project was to create the basis of what will become my professional portfolio. I plan on adding to and referencing this project as my portfolio changes.

Here is the reference photo I was given:

## What Comes Next? and other issues...

I plan on fixing a few features over the course of this bootcamp. I'd like to make my code, especially my CSS more efficient. I'd also like to practice creating more semantic HTML code.
The next concept I plan on tackling is media queries, as I am still having trouble understanding and applying them.

Here is a design bug I found while looking at my page on different viewports:

This also happens when I shrink the page as well, letting me know the left border of the affected element is likely tied to some display feature.

As you can see, the left border of the contact/footer section is not aligned with the others - something I did not catch looking at my laptop view (pictured below).

Another issue I have is using media queries to make my page display properly on a mobile devide. Although the page flexes, it is not how I'd like the page to be viewed.
