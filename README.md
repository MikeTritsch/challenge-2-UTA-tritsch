# challenge-2-UTA-tritsch
Challenge 2 for UT Austin's Full Stack Bootcamp

## Description

Welcome to my Colorado Rockies themed advanced CSS portfolio! This challenge was a huge learning process for me as I made a big effort to include all of the concepts I've learned so far in Bootcamp. I struggled with the concept of flexbox leading up to this, and rather than avoid it, I wanted to take it on as much as I could, and I think it shows here. My motivation behind this project was to create the basis of what will become my professional portfolio. I plan on adding to and referencing this project as my portfolio changes.


## What Comes Next?

I plan on fixing a few features over the course of this bootcamp. I'd like to make my code, especially my CSS more efficient. I'd also like to practice creating more semantic HTML code.

The next concept I plan on tackling is media queries, as I am still having trouble understanding and applying them.
